:::{.notes}
1. Landscape attributes may influence the level of transmission of an infection
2. Spatial variations in disease risk depend not only on the presence and area of critical habitats but also on their spatial configuration
3. Disease risk depends on the connectivity of habitats for vectors and hosts
4. The landscape is a proxy for specific associations of reservoir hosts and vectors linked with the emergence of multi-host diseases
5. To understand ecological factors influencing spatial variations of disease risk, one needs to take into account the pathways of pathogen transmission between vectors, hosts, and the physical environment
6. The emergence and distribution of infection through time and space is controlled by different factors acting at multiple scales
7. Landscape and meteorological factors control not just the emergence but also the spatial concentration and spatial diffusion of infection risk
8. Spatial variation in disease risk depends not only on land cover but also on land use, via the probability of contact between, on one hand, human hosts and, on the other hand, infectious vectors, animal hosts or their infected habitats
9. The relationship between land use and the probability of contact between vectors and animal hosts and human hosts is influenced by land ownership
10. Human behaviour is a crucial controlling factor of vector-human contacts, and of infection

## Challenges and gaps - RS
![](assets/img/lecture/satellite_b.png){.absolute top=5 right=-15 width=120}

- **Trade-off** between different RS resolutions, the problem under study, the data and methods available
- **Gaps in optical RS**: clouds, shadows in optical RS (spatial and temporal interpolations)
- Need for **corrections** if high level data is not suitable (ARD)
- **Limited access** to VHR, LiDAR, Hyper-spectral (US$, not easy to scale yet)
- Investment and capacity building: huge  volumes of data vs. limited bandwidth, storage and computational capacity (cloud computing, parallelisation | learning time and US$)

::: {.color-box-light-blue}
[**Field data will always be needed! :)**]{style="color: #1a428a;"}
:::

## Challenges and gaps - Ecology and Health

<br>

- Missing **baseline** distribution information of hosts, vectors, infection
- Updating and digitisation of disease cases and intervention data, data still missing in large parts of the world
- **Harmonisation of records** at different levels, i.e., municipal, provincial, national
- Facilitating access to (aggregated) health data 
- __Political decision and resource allocation__


## Opportunities: low hanging fruits?

- SAR data to avoid clouds, e.g., [**SAOCOM**](https://saocom.invap.com.ar/) to estimate soil moisture
- Open LiDAR data, e.g., [GEDI](https://gedi.umd.edu/) onboard of ISS
- GEE vs open source solutions [openEO.cloud](https://openeo.cloud/), [actinia](https://actinia.mundialis.de/), OpenPlains? ;-)
