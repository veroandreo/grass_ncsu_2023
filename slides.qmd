In this tutorial, we will use a custom machine on AWS to analyze satellite image collections _in the cloud_.
:::


## Cloud infrastructure (AWS)

- Lots of separate data centers with large clusters

![](img/aws.png)

- In total: > 25 regions and > 80 availability zones
- Basic service to run (virtual) machines: EC2 (Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud)



## Running a machine in the cloud (AWS)

1. Select a region and [machine instance type](https://aws.amazon.com/de/ec2/pricing/on-demand), based on costs, hardware, and OS

2. Create a key pair for accessing the machine over SSH

3. Click "Launch instance" and follow instructions

4. Connect via SSH and install software (PROJ, GDAL, R, RStudioServer[^1], R packages, ...)


_Notice that security considerations (e.g. by using IAM roles, multi-factor authorization) are **NOT** part of this tutorial._


[^1]: You need to add a security rule to allow public / protected access to RStudioServer.





## AWS Management Console

## Example platforms and available data

<br/><br/>

| Provider | Data |
|:--------|:------------------------------|
| Amazon web services (AWS) | Sentinel, Landsat, ERA 5, OSM, CMIP 6, and more, see [here](https://registry.opendata.aws/?search=tags:gis,earth%20observation,events,mapping,meteorological,environmental,transportation) |
| Google Cloud Platform | Landsat, Sentinel, [access to GEE data](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/cloud/earthengine_cloud_project_setup) |
| Microsoft Planetary Computer | Sentinel, Landsat, MODIS and more, see [here](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/catalog) |



## Object Storage: S3

EC2 machines have local storage (EBS) but big data archives use highly scalable **object storage**.

S3 elements:

- **Bucket**: container for objects that are stored in a specific AWS region 
- **Objects**: Individual files and corresponding metadata within a bucket, identified by a unique key
- **Key**: Filenames / Path or similar; unique within a bucket

Pricing (storage, transfer, requests):

- Bucket owner pays by default
- For **requester pays** buckets, transfer and requests are paid by users


## S3 examples

<br/><br/>

Buckets:

- [https://registry.opendata.aws/sentinel-2](https://registry.opendata.aws/sentinel-2)
- [https://registry.opendata.aws/usgs-landsat/](https://registry.opendata.aws/usgs-landsat/)


Object:

- [https://sentinel-cogs.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/sentinel-s2-l2a-cogs/20/J/ML/2022/3/S2B_20JML_20220330_0_L2A/B04.tif](https://sentinel-cogs.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/sentinel-s2-l2a-cogs/20/J/ML/2022/3/S2B_20JML_20220330_0_L2A/B04.tif)




## Data access


- Buckets are **not** a drive on your machine
- Data access over HTTP requests (PUT, GET, DELETE, ...)

<br/><br/>

### Challenges


1. How to find images by location, time, and other criteria? 

2. How to efficiently read image data from S3 without copying images to our machine storage first? 





# 3. Cloud-native geospatial: STAC, COGs, and data cubes {background-color="#546e7a"}



## STAC overview


- Standardized JSON-based language for describing catalogs of **spatiotemporal** data (imagery, point clouds, SAR)

- Extensible (available extensions include EO, Data Cubes, Point Clouds, and more)

- 1.0.0 release available since May 2021

- Growing ecosystem

## STAC specification



![](img/STAC_overview.png){fig-align="center"}


- **Items** are inseparable objects of data (assets) and metadata (e.g. a single satellite image)
- **Catalogs** can be nested
- **Collections** extend catalogs and can be used to group items and their metadata (e.g. license)



## STAC API

**Static STAC catalogs**

- Typically set of linked JSON files, starting with a `catalog.json`
- Catalog JSON contains links to collections, nested catalogs, or items
- Items contain assets (links to files) and metadata 
- Problem: All items must be processed for searching
- Example: [https://meeo-s5p.s3.amazonaws.com/catalog.json](https://stacindex.org/catalogs/sentinel-5p-level2-aws#/)


**STAC API**

- Web-service for dynamic search of STAC items by area of interest, datetime, and other metadata
- Compliant with OGC API - Features standard

**STAC Index**

- A good starting point to find available STAC collections and API services: [https://stacindex.org](https://stacindex.org)





## Cloud-optimized GeoTIFF (COG)

**Image file formats must be cloud-friendly to reduce transfer times and costs associated with transfer and requests**



:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
- COG = Normal **tiled** **GeoTIFF** files whose content follows a **specific order of data and metadata** ([see full spec here](https://github.com/cogeotiff/cog-spec/blob/master/spec.md))

- support compression

- support efficient **HTTP range requests**, i.e. partial reading of images (blocks, and overviews) over cloud storage

- may contain overview images (image pyramids) 
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

![](img/s2_overviews.png)
:::

::::


**[GDAL](https://gdal.org/) can efficiently read and write COGs, and access object storage in the cloud with [_virtual file systems_](https://gdal.org/user/virtual_file_systems.html)**





## Satellite image collections

Images spatially overlap, have different coordinate reference systems, have different pixel sizes depending on spectral bands, yield irregular time series for larger areas



![](img/screenshot_cophub.png){fig-align="center"}








## What is a data cube?

Here: **A four-dimensional (space, time, variable / band) regular raster data cube**

![](img/cube.png)

- collect all observations in one object
- $b \times t \times y \times x \rightarrow$ number
- single CRS, cells have constant temporal duration, and spatial size



## Data Cube creation is lossy



![](img/cubecreation.png)
**Important:** There is no single correct data cube!

::: {.column width="60%"}
### Disadvantages

- Not free

- GEE and others can be easier to use (some are free)

- Your institution's computing center might have more computing resources (_for free_)

- Setup and familiarization needed

- Depends on the existence of STAC-API services and imagery as COGs!
:::

::::

:::{.fragment}
→ Which tools / platforms / environments are most efficient to use highly depends on factors like _data volume, computational effort, data & method availability, effort needed to familiarization and reimplementation_, and others.

## Summary

- Cloud-computing platforms contain lots of satellite data

- Cloud storage differs from local storage

- Technology and tools: 

  - STAC (and STAC API!) for efficient and standardized search of spatiotemporal EO data
  
  - COGs allow efficiently reading parts of imagery, potentially on lower resolution
  
  - GDAL has everything for efficient data access on cloud storage
  
  - gdalcubes makes the creation and processing of data cubes from satellite image collections in R easier
